    "## About the Show 📺\n",
    "\n",
    "The Great British Bake Off (known in the US as the Great British Baking Show) is a competition-style reality television show where amateur bakers participate in themed baking challenges. Each week's episode revolves around a theme; past themes include Bread Week, Cake Week, Vegan Week, and Italian Week. In each episode, the bakers are given three timed challenges based on the week's theme: the Signature Challenge, the Technical Challenge, and the Showstopper Challenge. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Signature Challenge, the judges broadly specify what the bakers should make, and the bakers have freedom to use flavors, techniques, and recipes as they wish. The Signature Challenge earns its name because it's an opportunity for bakers to express themselves and their unique baking style to both the judges and the viewers at home. Many of the Signature Challenge bakes come from tried-and-tested recipes that contestants like to bake for their friends and families. For example, during Festivals Week in Season 10, the bakers were tasked with creating 24 buns themed around a world festival or holiday. Contestant Henry Bird made [these Chocolate Kardemummabullar](https://thegreatbritishbakeoff.co.uk/recipes/all/henry-chocolate-kardemummabullar/).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/signature_bake.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Technical Challenge, bakers have no idea what they will be asked to create until the timer for the challenge starts. This means they can't prepare for it, and they have to rely on their baking knowledge and intuition. The Technical Challenge earns its name because it tests the bakers' technical knowledge of baking as a discipline.  Each Technical Challenge is posed by one particular judge, using a recipe from the judge's own personal collection. Bakers are provided with ingredients and a recipe, which is usually extremely basic, sometimes lacking ingredient measurements or containing single steps like \"make a shortcrust pastry\" with no further explanation. The finished products are judged blind and ranked from worst to best. An example of a Technical Challenge includes [judge Paul Hollywood's Baklava](https://thegreatbritishbakeoff.co.uk/recipes/all/paul-hollywood-baklava/). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/baklava.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The third challenge, the Showstopper, is similar to the Signature Challenge, in that bakers are given requirements ahead of time and have freedom to create their own recipes and prepare ahead of time. The main difference is that the Showstoppers are more challenging and larger-scale. The judges are looking for bakes that are breathtaking in both their appearance and their taste. For example, during Bread Week in Season 6, the bakers were asked to create a 3-D bread sculpture. Contestant Paul Jagger impressed the judges and millions of viewers with his *King of the Jungle* lion sculpture.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/lion_bread_sculpture.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Each episode of the show features all three challenges. The contestants' bakes are tasted and assessed by two judges, and at the end of each episode, the hosts announce who will be eliminated from the competition and who will be recognized with a special award of \"Star Baker\" ⭐ (introduced in Season 2). Typically, one contestant is eliminated and one is crowned Star Baker ⭐, but on occasion there have been special cases in which zero or multiple people were eliminated or awarded Star Baker ⭐. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final episode of each season is held when there are just three bakers remaining. All three bakers compete in the final, and at the end, one winner is chosen and each of the others is considered a \"runner-up\". \n"

    "## About the Data 💾\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we'll be using a few different datasets, which we've loaded in and saved in DataFrames called\n",
    "- `baker_weeks`, \n",
    "- `challenge_results`,  \n",
    "- `technical_challenge_recipes`, and\n",
    "- `bakers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while the Great British Bake Off has filmed fifteen seasons, our datasets do not include the most recent seasons. Since our datasets come from different [sources](#sources) and were compiled at different times, some of these datasets include more seasons than others. In addition, the number of bakers each season has varied, but all seasons have filmed one episode per week.\n",
    " \n",
    "The `baker_weeks` DataFrame includes a breakdown of each baker's performance each week (that is, each episode), for the first eleven seasons of the show. Each row represents information **for one baker for one week**. This means that each baker will appear in the DataFrame multiple times. Bakers will continue to appear in the DataFrame even in weeks after they got eliminated, so these rows will have missing values (`NaN`).  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The `'Week Name'` column contains the theme of that week's episode. We also have the baker's name, gender (`'M'` and `'F'` are the only options), and age, the season number (also called the series number in other DataFrames), and the week number within that season. There are columns that indicate whether each baker was a Star Baker ⭐ that week, was eliminated that week, competed that week, or went on to win the season's competition 🥇. A few columns require more explanation about the show:\n",
    "- `'Judge'` is either `'Mary'` or `'Prue'`. For the first seven seasons, the show's two judges were [Paul Hollywood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Hollywood) and [Mary Berry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Berry). After that, the show switched networks and Mary Berry was replaced by [Prue Leith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prue_Leith). Since Paul Hollywood was a judge every season, the `'Judge'` column contains the name of the other judge.\n",
    "- `'technical_rank'` contains a number reflecting each baker's ranking in the Technical Challenge (with 1 meaning 1st place, 2 meaning 2nd place, etc.)\n",
    "-  `'Signature Handshake'` and `'Showstopper Handshake'` contain information on whether the contestant received a handshake \t🤝 from judge Paul Hollywood as he tasted their bake. Paul has a reputation for giving praise sparingly, and his so-called \"[Hollywood Handshakes 🤝](https://hollywoodhandshakes.com/)\" are considered a great honor. \n",

    "In this section, we will use permutation testing to decide if different groups of bakers have similar technical abilities, as measured by their rankings in the Technical Challenges. Let's start by looking at our `baker_weeks` DataFrame which has a row for each baker for each week of the show, including for the remainder of the season after they've been eliminated. Let's start by only keeping the data for the bakers that actually competed in each week's episode. Since ten bakers participated in the first episode of Season 1, we'll look at the first ten rows of the resulting `competed` DataFrame. "

    "\n",
    "Contestants on the Great British Bake Off sometimes groan when the hosts announce that the upcoming Technical Challenge was chosen by judge Paul Hollywood. Paul has a reputation for posing exceptionally difficult challenges and most bakers believe that his recipes are much harder than those of his co-judges, Mary Berry and Prue Leith. We want to examine whether this theory is justified by the data. \n",

    "The `technical_challenge_recipes` DataFrame contains 83 Technical Challenge recipes from seasons 1 through 9. Each Technical Challenge is posed by one particular judge, and comes from their personal collection of recipes. In the first nine seasons, Mary posed 32 Technical Challenges, Paul posed 41, and Prue posed 10. The `technical_challenge_recipes` DataFrame includes a `'DifficultyScore'` for each recipe, with more challenging recipes having higher scores."

    "So there is definitely a difference in mean difficulty scores between Mary's and Paul's Technical Challenge recipes, within our sample of recipes that have appeared as Technical Challenges in the show. But does this reflect a difference in mean recipe difficulty scores in the population (the judges' recipe collections), or was it by chance that our sample's difficulty displayed this difference? Let's do a hypothesis test to find out. We'll state our hypotheses as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis:** The mean difficulty of Mary's recipe collection equals the mean difficulty of Paul's recipe collection. Equivalently, the difference in the mean difficulty for Mary's and Paul's recipes equals 0.\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis:** The mean difficulty of Mary's recipe collection does not equal the mean difficulty of Paul's recipe collection. Equivalently, the difference in the mean difficulty for Mary's and Paul's recipe does not equal 0.\n",
